Often when dealing with problems in mathematics, we make use of certain facts. 
For example, when dealing with geometry problems on a flat surface, we often 
make use of the Pythagorean Theorem and the Angle Bisector Theorem. When 
dealing with quadratic equations, we can use the Quadratic Formula to 
calculate its roots. The Fundamental Theorem of Calculus gives us a way to 
relate integrals and derivatives.

But how do we *know* that the Pythagorean Theorem, Angle Bisector Theorem, or 
the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus are true? How do we know that the 
Quadratic Formula gives us the correct roots, and not some mere approximation, 
or worse outright lies about the roots? Can we trust that these theorems, or 
the myriad of other theorems, accurately describe reality?

The answer is that in order to establish these theorems as fact, they must be 
grounded in logic. If we use a system of logic to derive these theorems, then 
we can be confident in their application. While the study of logic is a deep 
philosophical rabbit hole, we can at least get by with the basics. Over the 
course of this chapter, we will become acquainted with the basic tools of 
logic. Even with the basic tools, a rich mathematical tapestry can be artfully 
weaved!
