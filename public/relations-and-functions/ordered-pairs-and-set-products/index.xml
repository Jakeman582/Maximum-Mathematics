    <title>Ordered Pairs and Set Products :: Maximum Mathematics</title>
    <link>http://localhost:1313/relations-and-functions/ordered-pairs-and-set-products/index.html</link>
    <description>Just as we saw how sets can be built via propositional logic, we’ll see how relations and functions are built up using sets, a clear example of how multiple seemingly disperate concepts can be accumulated into a cohesive whole. But before we delve into what relations and functions are exactly, there is one more set operation we should get acquainted with: the set product. Ironically, even though order doesn’t matter when considering elements in a set, constructing a set product does require that we know in what order we are doing things.</description>
