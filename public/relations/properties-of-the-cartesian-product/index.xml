    <description>The Cartesian Product of two sets is just another set. This means we can also use other set operations like union, intersection, and set differences.&#xA;In this section, we explore how the Cartesian Product interacts with the other set operators.&#xA;Associativity of the Cartesian Product We already discussed how order matters in Cartesian Products, and as such sets donâ€™t commute around the Cartesian Product operator $\times$. Associativity is another common property we should examine. What exactly is the difference between</description>
