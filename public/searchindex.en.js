But before we delve into what relations and functions are exactly, there is one more set operation we should get acquainted with: the set product. Ironically, even though order doesn’t matter when considering elements in a set, constructing a set product does require that we know in what order we are doing things. In this section, we discuss a new type of mathematical object that takes order into account.\nOrdered Pairs When we were discussing sets, we noted that order and repetition did not matter. All that mattered was whether or not an element was included in the set or not. Sometimes, we do care about the order in which elements are listed. In such a case, we list the elements between parentheses ( ) instead of curly braces { }.\nOrdered Pair An ordered pair is an ordered collection of two elements a and b, and is normally written using parentheses as in\n$$\\left(a, b\\right)$$where element a is the first item in the pair, and element b is the second item.\nNotice that the definition of ordered pair does not require that elements a and b have to come from the same universe (set). We can insert anything we want in an ordered pair.\nContrast ordered pairs with sets. Because order is irrelevant in sets, we have that\n$$ \\{a, b\\} = \\{b, a\\} $$whereas for ordered pairs, we have that (a, b) and (b, a) are different. In order for two different ordered pairs to be the same, we would need the corresponding parts to be the same.\nEqual Two ordered pairs (a, b) and (c, d) are called equal and we write\n$$\\left(a, b\\right) = \\left(c, d\\right)$$if (and only if) a = c and b = d.\nExample 4.1.1 The following are all examples of ordered pairs:\n\\[ \\begin{array}{ l l l } (1, -1) \u0026 (0, 12) \u0026 (12, 2.0013) \\\\ (5, \\text{tokyo}) \u0026 (3, 4) \u0026 (\\text{red}, -13) \\\\ (-\\pi^e, \\sqrt{2}) \u0026 (0, 12) \u0026 (0, -9) \\end{array} \\]Let’s let (a, b) refer to the upper-middle ordered pair above (0, 12), and let’s refer to the lower-middle ordered pair above (0, 12) as (c, d). Doing this tells us that\n\\[ \\begin{array}{ l l } a = 0 \u0026 b = 12 \\\\ c = 0 \u0026 d = 12 \\end{array} \\]Of course, we can easily see that since\n$$ a = c = 0 $$$$ b = d = 12 $$we must then have that (a, b) = (c, d), meaning that we really have that\n$$ (0, 12) = (0, 12) $$as expected. This is true by definition, but this is also easily seen because the corresponding elements of both ordered pairs are equal.\nNow compare (0, 12) to (0, -9). Let’s refer to these ordered pairs as\n$$ (0, 12) = (a, b) $$$$ (0, -9) = (c, d) $$Here, we see that while\n$$ a = c = 0 $$we also have that\n$$ b \\neq d $$because b = 12 and d = -9. Hence, we have that\n$$ (0, 12) \\neq (0, -9) $$as expected.\nOrdering Multiple Elements Naturally, we aren’t limited to two elements. We can collect as many elements as we want in a list. Equality of two n-tuples is also straightforward.\nn-Tuple, Equal An n-tuple is an ordered list of n elements and is normally written using parentheses as\n$$ (a_1, a_2,\\ldots, a_n) $$where $a_1$ is the first element in the n-tuple, $a_2$ is the second element, and so on as expected.\nTwo n-tuples $(a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n)$ and $(b_1, b_2, \\ldots, b_m)$ are called equal when they have the same number of elements (n = m), and their corresponding elements are equal to each other; that is, we have that\n$$ (a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n) = (b_1, b_2, \\ldots, b_m) $$if (and only if)\n$$ n = m $$and\n\\[ \\begin{array}{ c } a_1 = b_1 \\\\ a_2 = b_2 \\\\ \\vdots \\\\ a_n = b_m \\end{array} \\] It is common to refer to n-tuples with only two elements simply as tuples (in addition to ordered pairs), and n-tuples with three elements as triples (or ordered triples).\nExample 4.1.2 None of the following n-tuples are equal to each other because the order in which the elements appear is different between each ordered pair:\n\\[ \\begin{array}{ l l l} (1, 2, 3) \u0026 (2, 1, 3) \u0026 (3, 1, 2) \\\\ (1, 3, 2) \u0026 (2, 3, 1) \u0026 (3, 2, 1) \\end{array} \\]The following n-tuples are not equal to each other because they have a different number of elements:\n\\[ \\begin{array}{ l l } (1, 2, 3) \u0026 (1, 1, 2, 3) \\end{array} \\]",

    "content": "All of the set operations we’ve seen so far simply take some combination of elements from two given sets, and form a new conglomerate set. The same will be true of Cartesian Products.\nCartesian Products For all of the set operations we’ve seen so far, we essentially pick out only a subset of elements from each. What’s different about the Cartesian Product is that we iterate over all elements from both sets.\nCartesian Product, Set Product Let A and B be any two given sets.\nThe Cartesian Product of A and B, denoted\n$$ A \\times B $$is the set\n$$ A \\times B = \\{ (a, b)\\ |\\ a \\in A\\ \\land\\ b \\in B \\} $$Note that A and B do not need to be subsets from the same universe.\nSometimes, this is referred to as a Set Product.\nBasically, for each element in A, we iterate over all of the elements in B, forming ordered pairs where the element from A is the first item in the pair, and the element from B is the second item in the pair.\nWe can organize the construction of the Cartesian Product in a table like so:\n$A \\times B$ $b_1$ $b_2$ $\\ldots$ $b_m$ $a_1$ $(a_1, b_2)$ $(a_1, b_2)$ $\\cdots$ $(a_1, b_2)$ $a_2$ $(a_1, b_2)$ $(a_1, b_2)$ $\\cdots$ $(a_1, b_2)$ $\\vdots$ $\\vdots$ $\\vdots$ $\\ddots$ $\\vdots$ $a_n$ $(a_1, b_2)$ $(a_1, b_2)$ $\\cdots$ $(a_1, b_2)$ Remember that since we’re forming ordered pairs, the order in which we list the sets is also important.\nExample 4.2.1 Suppose we have\n$$A = \\{1, 2\\}$$$$B = \\{a, b, c\\}$$where a, b, c are not variables, but simply the first, second, and third letters of the English alphabet. Then we have that\n$$A \\times B = \\{ (1, a),\\ (1, b),\\ (1, c),\\ (2, a),\\ (2, b),\\ (2, c) \\}$$On the other hand, we have that\n$$B \\times A = \\{ (a, 1),\\ (a, 2),\\ (b, 1),\\ (b, 2),\\ (c, 1),\\ (c, 2) \\}$$We can use tables to verify that these are the correct Cartesian Products. For example, here’s the table for $A \\times B$:\n$A \\times B$ a b c 1 (1, a) (1, b) (1, c) 2 (2, a) (2, b) (2, c) Here’s the table for $B \\times A$:\n$B \\times A$ 1 2 a (a, 1) (a, 2) b (b, 1) (b, 2) c (c, 1) (c, 2) The fact that we can’t swap the order of the sets without potentially affecting the result deserves extra emphasis.\nOrder Matters in Cartesian Products In general, we have that\n$$A \\times B \\neq B \\times A$$ We are not limited to two sets.\nCartesian Products with Multiple Sets Just as we can take the product of multiple numbers, we can also take the Cartesian Product of multiple sets.\nMultiple Cartesian Product Let $A_1$, $A_2$, $\\ldots$, $A_n$ be arbitrary sets.\nThe Multiple Cartesian Product\n$$A_1 \\times A_2 \\times \\cdots \\times A_n$$is the set\n$$\\{(a_1,\\ a_2,\\ \\ldots,\\ a_n)\\ |\\ a_1 \\in A_1\\ \\land\\ a_2 \\in A_2\\ \\land\\ \\cdots\\ \\land\\ a_n \\in A_n\\}$$ Oftentimes, we refer to a Multiple Cartesian Product simply as a Cartesian Product.\nExample 4.2.2 Consider the following sets:\n\\[ \\begin{array}{ l c r } A = \\{1, 2\\} \u0026 B = \\{a, b\\} \u0026 C = \\{\\alpha, \\beta\\} \\end{array} \\]Then we have by definition that\n$$ A \\times B \\times C = \\{(1, a, \\alpha), (1, a, \\beta), (1, b, \\alpha), (1, b, \\beta), (2, a, \\alpha), (2, a, \\beta), (2, b, \\alpha), (2, b, \\beta) \\} $$Of course, swapping the order of A, B, C would yield slightly different sets, such as\n$$ B \\times A \\times C = \\{(a, 1, \\alpha), (a, 1, \\beta), (a, 2, \\alpha), (a, 2, \\beta), (b, 1, \\alpha), (b, 1, \\beta), (b, 2, \\alpha), (b, 2, \\beta) \\} $$ Though the examples we’ve seen all use different sets, we can use just one set multiple times.\nRepeated Cartesian Products Just as a number can be multiplied by itself multiple times, so too can sets. We use exponents to represent the number of times we are taking the Cartesian Product of a set with itself. Suppose that A represents some arbitrary set, the notation\n$$A^n$$is shorthand for the Cartesian Product\n$$\\underbrace{A \\times A \\times \\cdots \\times A}_{\\text{n times}}$$ Example 4.2.3 Consider the set\n$$A = \\{1,\\ a\\}$$We have that\n\\[ \\begin{align*} A^2 \u0026= A \\times A \\\\ \u0026= \\{(1, 1),\\ (1, a),\\ (a, 1),\\ (a, a)\\} \\end{align*} \\]We also have that\n\\[ \\begin{align*} A^3 \u0026= A \\times A \\times A \\\\ \u0026= \\{(1, 1, 1),\\ (1, 1, a),\\ (1, a, 1),\\ (1, a, a), (a, 1, 1),\\ (a, 1, a),\\ (a, a, 1),\\ (a, a, a)\\} \\end{align*} \\]",

    "content": "The Cartesian Product of two sets is just another set. This means we can also use other set operations like union, intersection, and set differences.\nIn this section, we explore how the Cartesian Product interacts with the other set operators.\nAssociativity of the Cartesian Product We already discussed how order matters in Cartesian Products, and as such sets don’t commute around the Cartesian Product operator $\\times$. Associativity is another common property we should examine. What exactly is the difference between\n\\[ \\begin{array}{ l c r} \\underline{(A \\times B) \\times C} \u0026 \\underline{A \\times B \\times C} \u0026 \\underline{A \\times (B \\times C)} \\end{array} \\]if any difference exists at all?\nRemember that parentheses are used to indicate which operations are to be performed first.\nExample 4.3.1 Consider the sets\n$$A = \\{1,\\ 2\\}$$$$B = \\{a,\\ b\\}$$$$C = \\{\\Psi,\\ \\Omega\\}$$(Note that $\\Psi$ and $\\Omega$ are letters from the Greek alphabet, and are being used here simply for the sake of variety.)\nFrom the previous section, we already know that\n$$A \\times B \\times C = \\{(1, a, \\Psi),\\ (1, a, \\Omega),\\ (1, b, \\Psi),\\ (1, b, \\Omega),\\ (2, a, \\Psi),\\ (2, a, \\Omega),\\ (2, b, \\Psi),\\ (2, b, \\Omega)\\}$$However, to compute $(A \\times B) \\times C$ and $A \\times (B \\times C)$, we must remember to compute what’s in parentheses first.\nComputing $(A \\times B) \\times C$ First, we must compute $A \\times B$ as follows:\n$$A \\times B = \\{(1, a),\\ (1, b),\\ (2, a),\\ (2, b)\\}$$Finally, we can now compute $(A \\times B) \\times C$ like so:\n\\[ \\begin{align*} (A \\times B) \\times C \u0026= \\{(1, a),\\ (1, b),\\ (2, a),\\ (2, b)\\} \\times \\{\\Psi,\\ \\Omega\\} \\\\ \u0026= \\{((1, a), \\Psi),\\ ((1, a), \\Omega),\\ ((1, b), \\Psi),\\ ((1, b), \\Omega),\\ ((2, a), \\Psi),\\ ((2, a), \\Omega),\\ ((2, b), \\Psi),\\ ((2, b), \\Omega)\\} \\end{align*} \\]Notice that each element of $(A \\times B) \\times C$ is an ordered pair, not an ordered triple like with $A \\times B \\times C$. Furthermore, each ordered pair in $(A \\times B) \\times C$ contains an ordered pair.\nBecause all of the parentheses can be confusing to look at, let’s list out all of the elements in $(A \\times B) \\times C$ in a grid:\n\\[ \\begin{array}{ c c} ((1, a), \\Psi) \u0026 ((1, a), \\Omega) \\\\ ((1, b), \\Psi) \u0026 ((1, b), \\Omega) \\\\ ((2, a), \\Psi) \u0026 ((2, a), \\Omega) \\\\ ((2, b), \\Psi) \u0026 ((2, b), \\Omega) \\\\ \\end{array} \\]Computing $A \\times (B \\times C)$ Computing $A \\times (B \\times C)$ is similar, except we of course start by computing $B \\times C$:\n\\[ \\begin{align*} A \\times (B \\times C) \u0026= \\{1, 2\\} \\times \\{(a, \\Psi),\\ (a, \\Omega),\\ (b, \\Psi),\\ (b, \\Omega)\\} \\\\ \u0026= \\{(1, (a, \\Psi)),\\ (1, (a, \\Omega)),\\ (1, (b, \\Psi)),\\ (1, (b, \\Omega)),\\ (2, (a, \\Psi)),\\ (2, (a, \\Omega)),\\ (2, (b, \\Psi)),\\ (2, (b, \\Omega))\\} \\end{align*} \\] Just as order matters when writing a Cartesian Product, the way we associate sets using parentheses in a Cartesian Product also matters, as demonstrated in Example 4.3.1. This deserves special emphasis.\nAssociation Matters with Cartesian Products The Cartesian Products\n\\begin{array}{ c c c } (A \\times B) \\times C \u0026 A \\times B \\times C \u0026 A \\times (B \\times C) \\end{array}\nare not equal to one another.\nBased on the above discussion, it should come as no surprise that\n$$A^m \\times A^n \\neq A^{m + n}$$Instead, $A^m \\times A^n$ is shorthand for\n$$(\\underbrace{A \\times A \\times \\cdots \\times A}_{\\text{m times}}) \\times (\\underbrace{A \\times A \\times \\cdots \\times A}_{\\text{n times}})$$whereas $A^{m + n}$ is shorthand for\n$$\\underbrace{A \\times A \\times \\cdots \\times A}_{\\text{m + n times}}$$Cartesian Products with the Empty Set Before we formally prove the next theorem, let’s take a moment to think about what would happen if we took the Cartesian Product of an arbitrary set A and the Empty Set.\nFor example, for every element in A, the Cartesian Product of A and B involves pairing the element in A with every element in B. However, if there were no elements in B, then there would be nothing to pair with the elements in A. Thus, no ordered pairs could be formed, and the resulting Cartesian Product would be empty.\nTheorem 4.3.1 For any arbitrary set A, we have that\n$$A \\times \\emptyset = \\emptyset$$$$\\emptyset \\times A = \\emptyset$$ Proof 4.3.1 General Strategy: By assuming that $A \\times \\emptyset$ is not empty, that would imply that $\\ \\emptyset$ has at least one element, contradicting the definition of the Empty Set. The exact same strategy works for $\\ \\emptyset \\times A$ as well.\nPresume - for the purpose of showing a contradiction - that $A \\times \\emptyset$ is non-empty. This would mean that there is at least one element in $A \\times \\emptyset$. That element would be an ordered pair which we’ll denote (a, ?). As such, we know that\n$$(a, ?) \\in A \\times \\emptyset$$Now, by the definition of Cartesian Product, we then have that\n\\[ \\begin{align*} a \u0026\\in A \\\\ ? \u0026\\in \\emptyset \\end{align*} \\]However, the fact that $? \\in \\emptyset$ contradicts the fact that $|\\emptyset| = 0$.\nHence, our presupposition that $A \\times \\emptyset$ is non-empty lead to a contradiction, meaning we must have that\n$$A \\times \\emptyset = \\emptyset$$as desired.\nShowing that $\\ \\emptyset \\times A = \\emptyset$ is nearly identical.\n$\\times$ Distributes Over $\\cup$ and $\\cap$ Here, we’ll see some of the distributive properties of the Cartesian Product.\nTheorem 4.3.2 For arbitrary sets A, B, C, we have that\n\\[ \\begin{align*} A \\times (B \\cup C) \u0026= (A \\times B) \\cup (A \\times C) \\\\ (A \\cup B) \\times C \u0026= (A \\times C) \\cup (B \\times C) \\end{align*} \\] Proof 4.3.2 General Strategy: We’ll prove that\n$$A \\times (B \\cup C) = (A \\times B) \\cup (A \\times C)$$by showing that each side is a subset of the other side. We’ll do this by using element arguments. The exact same logic also applies to showing that\n$$(A \\cup B) \\times C = (A \\times C) \\cup (B \\times C)$$so we’ll omit that part of the proof for the sake of brevity.\nStep 1: Show that $A \\times (B \\cup C) \\subseteq (A \\times B) \\cup (A \\times C)$ \\[ \\begin{array}{ r l l } \u0026 \\mathbf{(a, x) \\in A \\times (B \\cup C)} \u0026 \\textbf{Reason} \\\\ \\implies \u0026 (a \\in A) \\land (x \\in B \\cup C) \u0026 \\textit{Definition of Cartesian Product} \\\\ \\implies \u0026 (a \\in A) \\land [(x \\in B) \\lor (x \\in C)] \u0026 \\textit{Definition of Union} \\\\ \\implies \u0026 [(a \\in A) \\land (x \\in B)] \\lor [(a \\in A) \\land (x \\in C)] \u0026 \\textit{Distribution of } \\land \\textit{ over } \\lor \\\\ \\implies \u0026 [(a, x) \\in A \\times B] \\lor [(a, x) \\in A \\times C] \u0026 \\textit{Definition of Cartesian Product} \\\\ \\implies \u0026 (a, x) \\in (A \\times B) \\cup (A \\times C) \u0026 \\textit{Definition of Union} \\end{array} \\]Thus, we’ve just shown that whenever $(a, x) \\in A \\times (B \\cup C)$, we also have that $(a, x) \\in (A \\times B) \\cup (A \\times C)$. This means that we have by definition that\n$$A \\times (B \\cup C) \\subseteq (A \\times B) \\cup (A \\times C)$$Step 2: Show that $(A \\times B) \\cup (A \\times C) \\subseteq A \\times (B \\cup C)$ \\[ \\begin{array}{ r l l } \u0026 \\mathbf{(a, x) \\in (A \\times B) \\cup (A \\times C)} \u0026 \\textbf{Reason} \\\\ \\implies \u0026 [(a, x) \\in A \\times B] \\lor [(a, x) \\in A \\times C] \u0026 \\textit{Definition of Union} \\\\ \\implies \u0026 [(a \\in A) \\land (x \\in B)] \\lor [(a \\in A) \\land (x \\in C)] \u0026 \\textit{Definition of Cartesian Product} \\\\ \\implies \u0026 (a \\in A) \\land (x \\in B\\ \\lor\\ x \\in C) \u0026 \\textit{Distribution of } \\land \\textit{ of } \\lor \\\\ \\implies \u0026 (a \\in A) \\land (x \\in B \\cup C) \u0026 \\textit{Definition of Union} \\\\ \\implies \u0026 (a, x) \\in A \\times (B \\cup C) \u0026 \\textit{Definition of Cartesian Product} \\end{array} \\]Now we have shown that\n$$(A \\times B) \\cup (A \\times C) \\subseteq A \\times (B \\cup C)$$Conclusion: $A \\times (B \\cup C) = (A \\times B) \\cup (A \\times C)$ Because we’ve shown both\n$$A \\times (B \\cup C) \\subseteq (A \\times B) \\cup (A \\times C)$$$$(A \\times B) \\cup (A \\times C) \\subseteq A \\times (B \\cup C)$$we have, by definition of set equality, that\n$$A \\times (B \\cup C) = (A \\times B) \\cup (A \\times C)$$as desired!\nNotice that in the above proof that, even though mathematical definitions use $\\Longleftrightarrow$, we only considered one direction of the logical implication at a time (since we only used $\\implies$). That is why we had to beak the proof up into two steps along with a concluding step.\nHowever, with careful execution, we could have used $\\Longleftrightarrow$ to make the proof more compact.\nLet’s see an example of Theorem 4.3.2 in action.\nExample 4.3.2 Consider the sets\n\\[ \\begin{align*} A \u0026= \\{1, 2, 3\\} \\\\ B \u0026= \\{a, b\\} \\\\ C \u0026= \\{\\alpha, \\beta\\} \\end{align*} \\]According to Theorem 4.3.2, the two sets\n$$A \\times (B \\cup C)$$and\n$$(A \\times B) \\cup (A \\times C)$$should be equal. Let’s check.\nStep 1: Compute $A \\times (B \\cup C)$ First, we compute $B \\cup C$:\n\\[ \\begin{align*} B \\cup C \u0026= \\{a, b\\} \\cup \\{\\alpha, \\beta\\} \\\\ \u0026= \\{a, b, \\alpha, \\beta\\} \\end{align*} \\]Now we can compute $A \\times (B \\cup C)$:\n\\[ \\begin{align*} A \\times (B \\cup C) \u0026= \\{1, 2, 3\\} \\times \\{a, b, \\alpha, \\beta\\} \\\\ \u0026= \\{(1, a), (1, b), (1, \\alpha), (1, \\beta), (2, a), (2, b), (2, \\alpha), (2, \\beta), (3, a), (3, b), (3, \\alpha), (3, \\beta)\\} \\end{align*} \\]Let’s lay out all of these elements in a grid to get a better look:\n\\[ \\begin{array}{ c c c c } (1, a) \u0026 (1, b) \u0026 (1, \\alpha) \u0026 (1, \\beta) \\\\ (2, a) \u0026 (2, b) \u0026 (2, \\alpha) \u0026 (2, \\beta) \\\\ (3, a) \u0026 (3, b) \u0026 (3, \\alpha) \u0026 (3, \\beta) \\end{array} \\]Step 2: Compute $(A \\times B) \\cup (A \\times C)$ First, compute $A \\times B$:\n\\[ \\begin{align*} A \\times B \u0026= \\{1, 2, 3\\} \\times \\{a, b\\} \\\\ \u0026= \\{(1, a), (1, b), (2, a), (2, b), (3, a), (3, b)\\} \\end{align*} \\]Next, we compute $A \\times C$:\n\\[ \\begin{align*} A \\times C \u0026= \\{1, 2, 3\\} \\times \\{\\alpha, \\beta\\} \\\\ \u0026= \\{(1, \\alpha), (1, \\beta), (2, \\alpha), (2, \\beta), (3, \\alpha), (3, \\beta)\\} \\end{align*} \\]Finally, we can compute $(A \\times B) \\cup (A \\times C)$:\n\\[ \\begin{align*} (A \\times B) \\cup (A \\times C) \u0026= \\{(1, a), (1, b), (2, a), (2, b), (3, a), (3, b)\\} \\cup \\{(1, \\alpha), (1, \\beta), (2, \\alpha), (2, \\beta), (3, \\alpha), (3, \\beta)\\} \\\\ \u0026= \\{(1, a), (1, b), (1, \\alpha), (1, \\beta), (2, a), (2, b), (2, \\alpha), (2, \\beta), (3, a), (3, b), (3, \\alpha), (3, \\beta)\\} \\end{align*} \\]Just like before, let’s lay out all of these elements in a grid to get a better look:\n\\[ \\begin{array}{ c c c c } (1, a) \u0026 (1, b) \u0026 (1, \\alpha) \u0026 (1, \\beta) \\\\ (2, a) \u0026 (2, b) \u0026 (2, \\alpha) \u0026 (2, \\beta) \\\\ (3, a) \u0026 (3, b) \u0026 (3, \\alpha) \u0026 (3, \\beta) \\end{array} \\]As we can see, these are exactly the same elements we got from the Cartesian Product from Step 1. As such, we see that in this example, we have verified that\n$$A \\times (B \\cup C) = (A \\times B) \\cup (A \\times C)$$ In Theorem 4.3.2, we mentioned that A, B, C can be any arbitrary sets. This means any of the sets could be the empty set.\nExample 4.3.3 Consider the sets\n\\[ \\begin{align*} A \u0026= \\{1, 2, 3\\} \\\\ B \u0026= \\emptyset \\\\ C \u0026= \\{\\alpha, \\beta\\} \\end{align*} \\]Step 1: Compute $A \\times (B \\cup C)$ \\[ \\begin{align*} A \\times (B \\cup C) \u0026= A \\times (\\emptyset \\cup C) \\\\ \u0026= A \\times C \\\\ \u0026= \\{1, 2, 3\\} \\times \\{\\alpha, \\beta\\} \\\\ \u0026= \\{(1, \\alpha), (1, \\beta), (2, \\alpha), (2, \\beta), (3, \\alpha), (3, \\beta)\\} \\end{align*} \\]Step 2: Compute $(A \\times B) \\cup (A \\times C)$ According to Theorem 4.3.1, we have that $A \\times \\emptyset = \\emptyset$. This makes computing $(A \\times B) \\cup (A \\times C)$ much easier.\n\\[ \\begin{align*} (A \\times B) \\cup (A \\times C) \u0026= (A \\times \\emptyset) \\cup (A \\times C) \\\\ \u0026= \\emptyset \\cup (A \\times C) \\\\ \u0026= A \\times C \\\\ \u0026= \\{(1, \\alpha), (1, \\beta), (2, \\alpha), (2, \\beta), (3, \\alpha), (3, \\beta)\\} \\end{align*} \\]This is the exact same set we got in Step 1.\nIt’s worth noting that we could have side-stepped all of the above computation by using many of the previously discussed theorems like so:\n\\[ \\begin{align*} A \\times (B \\cup C) \u0026= A \\times (\\emptyset \\cup C) \\\\ \u0026= A \\times C \\\\ \u0026= \\emptyset \\cup (A \\times C) \\\\ \u0026= (A \\times \\emptyset) \\cup (A \\times C) \\\\ \u0026= (A \\times B) \\cup (A \\times C) \\end{align*} \\] Of course, we have a similar result for the intersection of sets:\nTheorem 4.3.3 For any arbitrary sets A, B, C, we have that\n\\[ \\begin{align*} A \\times (B \\cap C) \u0026= (A \\times B) \\cap (A \\times C) \\\\ (A \\cap B) \\times C \u0026= (A \\times C) \\cap (B \\times C) \\end{align*} \\] Proof 4.3.3 General Strategy: We’ll adopt a similar strategy we used in the proof of Theorem 4.3.2, except we’ll use logical equivalencies with $\\Longleftrightarrow$ instead of logical implications with $\\implies$. This will make the proof much more compact since we’ll only have to make one element argument instead of two.\nAgain, we’ll prove that\n$$A \\times (B \\cap C) = (A \\times B) \\cap (A \\times C)$$and omit the proof for\n$$(A \\cap B) \\times C = (A \\times C) \\cap (B \\times C)$$simply for the sake of brevity.\nWe begin by considering an arbitrary ordered pair (a, x) in the Cartesian Product $A \\times (B \\cap C)$:\n\\[ \\begin{array}{ r l l } \u0026 \\mathbf{(a, x) \\in A \\times (B \\cap C)} \u0026 \\textbf{Reason} \\\\ \\Longleftrightarrow \u0026 (a \\in A) \\land (x \\in B \\cap C) \u0026 \\textit{Definition of Cartesian Product} \\\\ \\Longleftrightarrow \u0026 (a \\in A) \\land (x \\in B) \\land (x \\in C) \u0026 \\textit{Definition of Intersection} \\\\ \\Longleftrightarrow \u0026 (a \\in A) \\land (a \\in A) \\land (x \\in B) \\land (x \\in C) \u0026 \\textit{Idempotent Law of } \\land \\\\ \\Longleftrightarrow \u0026 (a \\in A) \\land (x \\in B) \\land (a \\in A) \\land (x \\in C) \u0026 \\textit{Commutative Law of } \\land \\\\ \\Longleftrightarrow \u0026 [(a \\in A) \\land (x \\in B)] \\land [(a \\in A) \\land (x \\in C)] \u0026 \\textit{Associative Law of } \\land \\\\ \\Longleftrightarrow \u0026 [(a, x) \\in A \\times B] \\land [(a, x) \\in A \\times C] \u0026 \\textit{Definition of Cartesian Product} \\\\ \\Longleftrightarrow \u0026 (a, x) \\in (A \\times B) \\cap (A \\times C) \u0026 \\textit{Definition of Intersection} \\end{array} \\]Thus, we have shown that\n$$(a, x) \\in A \\times (B \\cap C)\\ \\Longleftrightarrow\\ (a, x) \\in (A \\times B) \\cap (A \\times C)$$which is logically equivalent to showing both\n\\[ \\begin{align*} (a, x) \\in A \\times (B \\cap C) \u0026\\implies (a, x) \\in (A \\times B) \\cap (A \\times C) \\\\ (a, x) \\in (A \\times B) \\cap (A \\times C) \u0026\\implies (a, x) \\in A \\times (B \\cap C) \\end{align*} \\]meaning that we have that\n\\[ \\begin{align*} A \\times (B \\cap C) \u0026\\subseteq (A \\times B) \\cap (A \\times C) \\\\ (A \\times B) \\cap (A \\times C) \u0026\\subseteq A \\times (B \\cap C) \\end{align*} \\]This means that, by definition of set equality, we have\n$$A \\times (B \\cap C) = (A \\times B) \\cap (A \\times C)$$as desired!\nLet’s see some examples involving intersections.\nExample 4.3.4 Consider the sets\n\\[ \\begin{align*} A \u0026= \\{1, 2, 3\\} \\\\ B \u0026= \\{a, b\\} \\\\ C \u0026= \\{b, c\\} \\end{align*} \\]Step 1: Compute $A \\times (B \\cap C)$ Computing $B \\cap C$ yields\n\\[ \\begin{align*} B \\cap C \u0026= \\{a, b\\} \\cap \\{b, c\\} \\\\ \u0026= \\{b\\} \\end{align*} \\]Now we compute $A \\times (B \\cap C)$\n\\[ \\begin{align*} A \\times (B \\cap C) \u0026= \\{1, 2, 3\\} \\times \\{b\\} \\\\ \u0026= \\{(1, b), (2, b), (3, b)\\} \\end{align*} \\]Step 2: Compute $(A \\times B) \\cap (A \\times C)$ First, we compute $A \\times B$:\n\\[ \\begin{align*} A \\times B \u0026= \\{1, 2, 3\\} \\times \\{a, b\\} \\\\ \u0026= \\{(1, a), (1, b), (2, a), (2, b), (3, a), (3, b)\\} \\end{align*} \\]Next, we compute $A \\times C$\n\\[ \\begin{align*} A \\times C \u0026= \\{1, 2, 3\\} \\times \\{b, c\\} \\\\ \u0026= \\{(1, b), (1, c), (2, b), (2, c), (3, b), (3, c)\\} \\end{align*} \\]Finally, we compute $(A \\times B) \\cap (A \\times C)$\n\\[ \\begin{align*} (A \\times B) \\cap (A \\times C) \u0026= \\{(1, a), (1, b), (2, a), (2, b), (3, a), (3, b)\\} \\cap \\{(1, b), (1, c), (2, b), (2, c), (3, b), (3, c)\\} \\\\ \u0026= \\{(1, b), (2, b), (3, b)\\} \\end{align*} \\]This is the exact same result we got earlier in Step 1.\nExample 4.3.5 Consider the sets\n\\[ \\begin{align*} A \u0026= \\{1, 2, 3\\} \\\\ B \u0026= \\{a, b\\} \\\\ C \u0026= \\{\\alpha, \\beta\\} \\end{align*} \\]Because\n\\[ \\begin{align*} B \\cap C \u0026= \\{ a, b \\} \\cap \\{\\alpha, \\beta\\} \\\\ \u0026= \\emptyset \\end{align*} \\]we have by Theorem 4.3.1 that\n\\[ \\begin{align*} A \\times (B \\cap C) \u0026= A \\times \\emptyset \\\\ \u0026= \\emptyset \\end{align*} \\]Now when computing $(A \\times B) \\cap (A \\times C)$, we start by computing $A \\times B$ and $A \\times C$ like so:\n\\[ \\begin{align*} A \\times B \u0026= \\{(1, a), (1, b), (2, a), (2, b), (3, a), (3, b)\\} \\\\ A \\times C \u0026= \\{(1, \\alpha), (1, \\beta), (2, \\alpha), (2, \\beta), (3, \\alpha), (3, \\beta)\\} \\end{align*} \\]$A \\times B$ and $A \\times C$ don’t have any common elements, meaning we have that\n$$(A \\times B) \\cap (A \\times C) = \\emptyset$$which is exactly what we got when computing $A \\times (B \\cap C)$.\nOnce again, we see that $A \\times (B \\cap C) = (A \\times B) \\cap (A \\times C)$.\nCartesian Products involving Subsets There is an interplay between Cartesian Products and subsets.\nTheorem 4.3.4 For any non-empty sets A, B, C, and D, we have that\n$$(A \\times B) \\subseteq (C \\times D) \\Longleftrightarrow (A \\subseteq C) \\land (B \\subseteq D)$$ Proof 4.3.4 General Strategy: Since we’re trying to prove a logical equivalency, we’ll break the proof up into two steps. In both steps, we’ll use element arguments by picking arbitrary ordered pairs of the form (x, y).\nStep 1: $(A \\times B) \\subseteq (C \\times D) \\implies (A \\subseteq C) \\land (B \\subseteq D)$ Suppose it were true that $(A \\times B) \\subseteq (C \\times D)$, and that A, B, C, and D were non-empty. Since A and B are non-empty, we must also have that $A \\times B$ is non-empty.\nSince $A \\times B$ is non-empty, we can pick out an arbitrary element from $A \\times B$, which we’ll refer to as (x, y).\nBecause $(x, y) \\in A \\times B$ and because $A \\times B \\subseteq C \\times D$, we must have that $(x, y) \\in C \\times D$. as well.\nNow, since $(x, y) \\in A \\times B$, we know (by the definition of Cartesian Product) that $(x \\in A) \\land (y \\in B)$.\nSince we also know that $(x, y) \\in C \\times D$, we similarly know that $(x \\in C) \\land (y \\land D)$.\nThus, whenever $x \\in A$, we also know that $x \\in C$, meaning that we have\n$$A \\subseteq C$$For similar reasons involving element y, we also have that\n$$B \\subseteq D$$Thus, we have established that\n$$(A \\times B) \\subseteq (C \\times D) \\implies (A \\subseteq C) \\land (B \\subseteq D)$$completing Step 1.\nStep 2: $(A \\subseteq C) \\land (B \\subseteq D) \\implies (A \\times B) \\subseteq (C \\times D)$ Suppose it were true that $A \\subseteq C$, $B \\subseteq D$ and that A, B, C, and D were all non-empty.\nBecause both A and B are non-empty, we have that $A \\times B$ is non-empty, meaning that we can pick an arbitrary element from $A \\times B$, which we’ll refer to as (x, y).\nBecause $(x, y) \\in A \\times B$, we have by definition of Cartesian Product that $x \\in A$ and $y \\in B$.\nNow, since $x \\in A$ and $A \\subseteq C$, we also have that $x \\in C$. Similarly, since $y \\in B$ and $B \\subseteq D$, we also have that $y \\in D$.\nSince $(x \\in C) \\land (y \\in D)$, we have by definition of Cartesian Product that $(x, y) \\in C \\times D$.\nThus, when ever $(x, y) \\in A \\times B$, we also have that $(x, y) \\in C \\times D$ as well. This means we have established that\n$$(A \\subseteq C) \\land (B \\subseteq D) \\implies (A \\times B) \\subseteq (C \\times D)$$completing Step 2.\nConclusion: $(A \\times B) \\subseteq (C \\times D) \\Longleftrightarrow (A \\subseteq C) \\land (B \\subseteq D)$ From Steps 1 and 2, we have established that\n\\[ \\begin{align*} (A \\times B) \\subseteq (C \\times D) \u0026\\implies (A \\subseteq C) \\land (B \\subseteq D) \\\\ (A \\subseteq C) \\land (B \\subseteq D) \u0026\\implies (A \\times B) \\subseteq (C \\times D) \\end{align*} \\]Therefore, we have that\n$$(A \\times B) \\subseteq (C \\times D) \\Longleftrightarrow (A \\subseteq C) \\land (B \\subseteq D)$$as desired.\nA couple of examples are in order.\nExample 4.3.6 Consider the sets\n\\[ \\begin{align*} A \u0026= \\{1, 2\\} \\\\ B \u0026= \\{a, b\\} \\\\ C \u0026= \\{1, 2, 3\\} \\\\ D \u0026= \\{a, b\\} \\\\ \\end{align*} \\]It’s easy to see that $A \\subseteq C$ and $B \\subseteq D$.\nLet’s compute both $A \\times B$ and $C \\times D$:\n\\[ \\begin{align*} A \\times B \u0026= \\{1, 2\\} \\times \\{a, b\\} \\\\ \u0026= \\{(1, a), (1, b), (2, a), (2, b)\\} \\\\ \\\\ C \\times D \u0026= \\{1, 2, 3\\} \\times \\{a, b\\} \\\\ \u0026= \\{(1, a), (1, b), (2, a), (2, b), (3, a), (3, b)\\} \\end{align*} \\]It’s easy to see that all four ordered pairs in $A \\times B$ are in $C \\times D$:\n\\[ \\begin{align*} (1, a) \u0026\\in \\{(1, a), (1, b), (2, a), (2, b), (3, a), (3, b)\\} \\\\ (1, b) \u0026\\in \\{(1, a), (1, b), (2, a), (2, b), (3, a), (3, b)\\} \\\\ (2, a) \u0026\\in \\{(1, a), (1, b), (2, a), (2, b), (3, a), (3, b)\\} \\\\ (2, b) \u0026\\in \\{(1, a), (1, b), (2, a), (2, b), (3, a), (3, b)\\} \\\\ \\end{align*} \\]Thus we have that $(A \\times B) \\subseteq (C \\times D)$ as expected.\nExample 4.3.7 Consider the sets\n\\[ \\begin{align*} A \u0026= \\{1, 2, 3\\} \\\\ B \u0026= \\{a, b\\} \\\\ C \u0026= \\{8, 9\\} \\\\ D \u0026= \\{x, y, z\\} \\\\ \\end{align*} \\]Notice that A is not a subset of C, and B is not a subset of D. Thus we’d expect that since\n$$(A \\subseteq C) \\land (B \\subseteq D) = 0$$and\n$$(A \\times B) \\subset (C \\times D) \\Longleftrightarrow (A \\subseteq C) \\land (B \\subseteq D)$$we’d have by Theorem 4.3.4 that\n$$(A \\times B) \\subseteq (C \\times D) = 0$$meaning $A \\times B$ is not a subset of $C \\times D$ (expressed in the language of propositions).\nWe can avoid computing both $A \\times B$ and $C \\times D$ by noting that since $1 \\in A$ the set $A \\times B$ will have ordered pairs where the first element is 1. However, since $1 \\notin C$, none of the ordered pairs in $C \\times D$ will have a 1 as the first element. This means that $A \\times B$ has at least one element not in $C \\times D$, and so we have that\n$$A \\times B \\nsubseteq C \\times D$$as expected.\nWe could compute $A \\times B$ and $C \\times D$, however by stopping and thinking, we saved ourselves a lot of work!\nNotice that Theorem 4.2.4 required that A, B, C, and D all be non-empty. Indeed, the proof of Theorem 4.2.4 required that we be able to pick arbitrary elements from A and B, as well as showing that they were also in C and D respectively.\nWhat happens when one or more of the sets involved is the Empty Set?\nExample 4.3.8 Consider the sets\n\\[ \\begin{align*} A \u0026= \\emptyset \\\\ B \u0026= \\{a, b\\} \\\\ C \u0026= \\{1, 2, 3\\} \\\\ D \u0026= \\{a, b\\} \\end{align*} \\]Here, we see that both $A \\subseteq C$ and $B \\subseteq D$.\nFurthermore, we see that\n\\[ \\begin{align*} A \\times B \u0026= \\emptyset \\times \\{a, b\\} \\\\ \u0026= \\emptyset \\\\ \\\\ C \\times D \u0026= \\{1, 2, 3\\} \\times \\{a, b\\} \\\\ \u0026= \\{(1, a), (1, b), (2, a), (2, b), (3, a), (3, b)\\} \\end{align*} \\]and so we can easily see that $(A \\times B) \\subseteq (C \\times D)$.\nUsing the language of propositional logic, we would say that the proposition $(A \\subseteq C) \\land (B \\subseteq D)$ evaluates to true; in other words, we have that\n$$(A \\subseteq C) \\land (B \\subseteq D) = 1$$Furthermore we see that the proposition $(A \\times B) \\subseteq (C \\times D)$ also evaluates to true, meaning we have that\n$$(A \\times B) \\subseteq (C \\times D) = 1$$As such, we see that\n\\[ \\begin{align*} (A \\times B) \\subseteq (C \\times D) \\longleftrightarrow (A \\subseteq C) \\land (B \\subseteq D) \u0026= 1 \\longleftrightarrow 1 \\\\ \u0026= 1 \\end{align*} \\]We see that introducing the Empty Set does not necessarily “break” Theorem 4.3.4 because it held true in this case. But is that always the case? What if we make a different set empty?\nExample 4.3.9 Consider the sets\n\\[ \\begin{align*} A \u0026= \\{1, 2\\} \\\\ B \u0026= \\{a, b\\} \\\\ C \u0026= \\{1, 2, 3\\} \\\\ D \u0026= \\emptyset \\end{align*} \\]Here, we see that while $A \\subseteq C$, we have that $B \\nsubseteq D$, meaning\n$$(A \\subseteq C) \\land (B \\subseteq D) = 0$$Computing $A \\times B$ and $C \\times D$ yields the following:\n\\[ \\begin{align*} A \\times B \u0026= \\{1, 2\\} \\times \\{a, b\\} \\\\ \u0026= \\{(1, a), (1, b), (2, a), (2, b)\\} \\\\ \\\\ C \\times D \u0026= \\{1, 2, 3\\} \\times \\emptyset \\\\ \u0026= \\emptyset \\end{align*} \\]Thus we see that $(A \\times B) \\nsubseteq (C \\times D)$, meaning\n$$(A \\times B) \\subseteq (C \\times D) = 0$$Since both propositions $(A \\subseteq C) \\land (B \\subseteq D) = 0$ and $(A \\times B) \\subseteq (C \\times D) = 0$ evaluated to false, Theorem 4.3.4 seems to still hold true in this case as well. Again, we can use propositional logic to more closely examine the situation:\n\\[ \\begin{align*} (A \\times B) \\subseteq (C \\times D) \\longleftrightarrow (A \\subseteq C) \\land (B \\subseteq D) \u0026= 0 \\longleftrightarrow 0 \\\\ \u0026= 1 \\end{align*} \\] In Example 4.3.8 and Example 4.3.9, we saw that only making one of four sets empty, the proposition\n$$(A \\times B) \\subseteq (C \\times D) \\longleftrightarrow (A \\subseteq C) \\land (B \\subseteq D)$$still evaluated to true. Let’s examine one more example where more than one set is empty.\nExample 4.3.10 Consider the sets\n\\[ \\begin{align*} A \u0026= \\{1, 2\\} \\\\ B \u0026= \\emptyset \\\\ C \u0026= \\emptyset \\\\ D \u0026= \\{a, b\\} \\end{align*} \\]We can immediately see that $A \\nsubseteq C$ and that $B \\subseteq D$.\nComputing $A \\times B$ and $C \\times D$ is easy since $B = D = \\emptyset$:\n\\[ \\begin{align*} A \\times B \u0026= \\{1, 2\\} \\times \\emptyset \\\\ \u0026= \\emptyset \\\\ \\\\ C \\times D \u0026= \\emptyset \\times \\{a, b\\} \\\\ \u0026= \\emptyset \\end{align*} \\]Of course we have that $\\emptyset \\subseteq \\emptyset$.\nAgain, we can examine this more closely using propositional logic:\n\\[ \\begin{align*} (A \\times B) \\land (C \\times D) \\longleftrightarrow (A \\subseteq C) \\land (B \\subseteq D) \u0026= 1 \\longleftrightarrow 0 \\\\ \u0026= 0 \\end{align*} \\]So, having two empty sets is enough to make the proposition false, meaning we finally “broke” Theorem 4.3.4.\nTheorem 4.3.4 requires all involved sets need to be non-empty. Even if some of the sets are empty, both $(A \\times B) \\land (C \\times D)$ and $(A \\subseteq C) \\land (B \\subseteq D)$ can evaluate to the same logical value, but Theorem 4.3.4 does not apply in those situations. Instead, other methods must be employed, such as verifying by hand.\nExperiment with Theorem Premises Always pay careful attention to the premises of any theorem you are working with. If even one premise is not met, then the theorem does not apply. It’s still possible that the conclusion of the theorem could be true, but not because of the theorem itself. Instead, other theorems, definitions, or axioms must be used to establish the conclusion’s truth.\nIt’s good practice to experiment and come up with scenarios where not all of the theorem’s premises are true. Trying to “break” a theorem is a great way to understand why a theorem is true.\n$\\times$ Distributes Over - and $\\triangle$ There are two more operators to discuss. First, we’ll look at how $\\times$ interacts with set differences.\nTheorem 4.3.5 For any sets A, B, and C, we have that\n$$A \\times (B - C) = (A \\times B) - (A \\times C)$$ Proof 4.3.5 Gelneral Strategy: The proof is relatively straight-forward, relying mainly on the definitions of various set operators. The actual proof will be an element argument.\nLet (a, x) be an arbitrarily picked element from $A \\times (B - C)$.\n\\[ \\begin{array}{ r l l } \u0026 \\mathbf{(a, x) \\in A \\times (B - C)} \u0026 \\textbf{Reason} \\\\ \\Longleftrightarrow \u0026 (a \\in A) \\land (x \\in B) \\land (x \\notin C) \u0026 \\textit{Definition of Cartesian Product} \\\\ \\Longleftrightarrow \u0026 (a \\in A) \\land (a \\in A) \\land (x \\in B) \\land (x \\notin C) \u0026 \\textit{Idempotent Law of } \\land \\\\ \\Longleftrightarrow \u0026 (a \\in A) \\land (x \\in B) \\land (a \\in A) \\land (x \\notin C) \u0026 \\textit{Commutative Law of } \\land \\\\ \\Longleftrightarrow \u0026 \\bigl[(a \\in A) \\land (x \\in B)\\bigr] \\land \\bigl[(a \\in A) \\land (x \\notin C)\\bigr] \u0026 \\textit{Associative Law of } \\land \\\\ \\Longleftrightarrow \u0026 (a, x) \\in (A \\times B) \\land (a, x) \\notin (A \\times C) \u0026 \\textit{Definition of Cartesian Product} \\end{array} \\]Showing that $(a, x) \\in A \\times (B - C) \\Longleftrightarrow (a, x) \\in (A \\times B) - (A \\times C)$ is of course equivalent to showing that\n\\[ \\begin{align*} (a, x) \\in A \\times (B - C) \u0026\\implies (a, x) \\in (A \\times B) - (A \\times C) \\\\ (a, x) \\in (A \\times B) - (A \\times C) \u0026\\implies (a, x) \\in A \\times (B - C) \\end{align*} \\]which (by definition of subset) means we have also shown that\n\\[ \\begin{align*} A \\times (B - C) \u0026\\subseteq (A \\times B) - (A \\times C) \\\\ (A \\times B) - (A \\times C) \u0026\\subseteq A \\times (B - C) \\end{align*} \\]This means that we have shown that\n$$A \\times (B - C) = (A \\times B) - (A \\times C)$$If we can’t pick an arbitrary element from $A \\times (B - C)$, then $A \\times (B - C)$ would have to be empty, meaning either $A = \\emptyset$ or $B - C = \\emptyset$.\nIf $A = \\emptyset$, then we would have that\n\\[ \\begin{align*} (A \\times B) - (A \\times C) \u0026= (\\emptyset \\times B) - (\\emptyset \\times C) \\\\ \u0026= \\emptyset - \\emptyset \\\\ \u0026= \\emptyset \\\\ \u0026= \\emptyset \\times (B - C) \\\\ \u0026= A \\times (B - C) \\end{align*} \\]If $B - C = \\emptyset$, then we would have that $B \\subseteq C$. Furthermore, since $A \\subseteq A$, Theorem 4.3.4 tells us that $(A \\times B) \\subseteq (A \\times C)$, meaning we have that\n\\[ \\begin{align*} (A \\times B) - (A \\times C) \u0026= \\emptyset \\\\ \u0026= A \\times \\emptyset \\\\ \u0026= A \\times (B - C) \\end{align*} \\]Whether $A \\times (B - C)$ is empty or not, we see that we always get that\n$$A \\times (B - C) = (A \\times B) - (A \\times C)$$as desired.\nWe can use Theorem 4.3.5 to help us prove the next theorem.\nTheorem 4.3.6 For any sets A, B, C, we have that\n$$A \\times (B\\ \\triangle\\ C) = (A \\times B)\\ \\triangle\\ (A \\times C)$$ Proof 4.3.6 General Strategy: We’ll use a bunch of previous theorems and definitions to directly establish equality.

First, we compute $A \\times B$. Next we compute $A \\times C$.\n\\[ \\begin{align*} A \\times B \u0026= \\{x, y, z\\} \\times \\{1, 2, 3\\} \\\\ \u0026= \\{(x, 1), (x, 2), (x, 3), (y, 1), (y, 2), (y, 3), (z, 1), (z, 2), (z, 3)\\} \\\\ \\\\ A \\times C \u0026= \\{x, y, z\\} \\times \\{1, 4\\} \\\\ \u0026= \\{(x, 1), (x, 4), (y, 1), (y, 4), (z, 1), (z, 4)\\} \\end{align*} \\]We can see that since $A \\times B$ and $A \\times C$ both contain the elements (x, 1), (y, 1), and (z, 1), those ordered pairs will not appear in the set difference:\n\\[ \\begin{align*} (A \\times B) - (A \\times C) \u0026= (A \\times B) \\\\ \u0026= \\{(x, 2), (x, 3), (y, 2), (y, 3), (z, 2), (z, 3)\\} \\\\ \u0026= A \\times (B - C) \\end{align*} \\]Thus we see that Theorem 4.3.5 holds.\nExample 4.3.12 Reconsider the sets from Example 4.3.11:\n\\[ \\begin{align*} A \u0026= \\{x, y, z\\} \\\\ B \u0026= \\{1, 2, 3\\} \\\\ C \u0026= \\{1, 4\\} \\end{align*} \\]Theorem 4.3.6 says that the two sets $A \\times (B\\ \\triangle\\ C)$ and $(A \\times B)\\ \\triangle\\ (A \\times C)$ are equal. Let’s verify that is the case by first computing $A \\times (B\\ \\triangle\\ C)$:\n\\[ \\begin{align*} A \\times (B\\ \\triangle\\ C) \u0026= \\{x, y, z\\} \\times \\bigl(\\{1, 2, 3\\}\\ \\triangle\\ \\{1, 4\\}\\bigr) \\\\ \u0026= \\{x, y, z\\} \\times \\{2, 3, 4\\} \\\\ \u0026= \\{(x, 2), (x, 3), (x, 4), (y, 2), (y, 3), (y, 4), (z, 2), (z, 3), (z, 4)\\} \\end{align*} \\]Now we compute $(A \\times B)\\ \\triangle\\ (A \\times C)$:\n\\[ \\begin{align*} A \\times B \u0026= \\{x, y, z\\} \\times \\{1, 2, 3\\} \\\\ \u0026= \\{(x, 1), (x, 2), (x, 3), (y, 1), (y, 2), (y, 3), (z, 1), (z, 2), (z, 3)\\} \\\\ \\\\ A \\times C \u0026= \\{x, y, z\\} \\times \\{1, 4\\} \\\\ \u0026= \\{(x, 1), (x, 4), (y, 1), (y, 4), (z, 1), (z, 4)\\} \\\\ \\\\ (A \\times B)\\ \\triangle\\ (A \\times C) \u0026= \\{(x, 2), (x, 3), (x, 4), (y, 2), (y, 3), (y, 4), (z, 2), (z, 3), (z, 4)\\} \\\\ \u0026= A \\times (B\\ \\triangle\\ C) \\end{align*} \\]And so it appears that Theorem 4.3.6 has come through. Of course, it looks like if we ever need to compute $(A \\times B)\\ \\triangle\\ (A \\times C)$ for whatever reason, we can save a lot of work by computing $A \\times (B\\ \\triangle\\ C)$ instead.",

    "content": "When we form the Cartesian Product $A \\times B$, we are essentially pairing up every element in A with every element in B. However, we may not want to associate every element of A with every element in B. Instead, we may only want to pair up certain elements together because they satisfy some condition.\nThe way we pair up only certain elements from A to certain elements of B is to take a subset of $A \\times B$. These kinds of subsets are yet another fundamental structure that appear all throughout all of mathematics.\nDefining Relations As stated above, we often want to take subsets of Cartesian Products.\nRelation A subset of $A \\times B$ is called a relation; more specifically, it is called a (binary) relation from A to B. Typically, a relation is denoted by the symbol $\\mathcal{R}$.\nFor a relation $\\mathcal{R}$ derived from $A \\times B$, whenever we have that\n$$(a, b) \\in \\mathcal{R}$$we can instead write\n$$a\\ \\mathcal{R}\\ b$$to specify that element a is related to element b.\nThe reason the word binary was used in the definition is because there were two sets being used to form the relation. Let’s look at a few examples.\nExample 4.4.1 Consider the following two sets:\n\\[ \\begin{align*} A \u0026= \\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5\\} \\\\ B \u0026= \\{2, 4, 6, 8, 10\\} \\end{align*} \\]We have that\n\\[ \\begin{array}{c c c c c c c c c} A \\times B \u0026 = \u0026 \\{ \u0026 (1, 2), \u0026 (1, 4), \u0026 (1, 6), \u0026 (1, 8), \u0026 (1, 10), \u0026 \\\\ \u0026 \u0026 \u0026 (2, 2), \u0026 (2, 4), \u0026 (2, 6), \u0026 (2, 8), \u0026 (2, 10), \u0026 \\\\ \u0026 \u0026 \u0026 (3, 2), \u0026 (3, 4), \u0026 (3, 6), \u0026 (3, 8), \u0026 (3, 10), \u0026 \\\\ \u0026 \u0026 \u0026 (4, 2), \u0026 (4, 4), \u0026 (4, 6), \u0026 (4, 8), \u0026 (4, 10), \u0026 \\\\ \u0026 \u0026 \u0026 (5, 2), \u0026 (5, 4), \u0026 (5, 6), \u0026 (5, 8), \u0026 (5, 10) \u0026 \\} \\\\ \\end{array} \\]where we spaced out the elements to make it easier to see what elements are in $A \\times B$.\nFor our first example of a relation, let’s just pick a subset of $A \\times B$ consisting of arbitrarily picked elements without any rhyme or reason:\n$$\\mathcal{R}_1 = \\{(1, 2), (3, 2), (2, 4), (3, 4), (1, 6), (1, 8), (2, 8), (5, 8), (5, 10)\\}$$For this first relation, we see that the number 1, taken from set A, is related to a few different numbers from B:\n\\[ \\begin{align*} 1\\ \u0026\\mathcal{R}_1\\ 2 \\\\ 1\\ \u0026\\mathcal{R}_1\\ 6 \\\\ 1\\ \u0026\\mathcal{R}_1\\ 8 \\end{align*} \\]We also see that 3 (taken from set A) is also related to a couple of elements from B:\n\\[ \\begin{align*} 3\\ \\mathcal{R}_1\\ 2 \\\\ 3\\ \\mathcal{R}_1\\ 4 \\end{align*} \\]We also see that numbers 2 and 5 from A are also related to a few different numbers from B:\n\\[ \\begin{array}{ c c } 2\\ \\mathcal{R}_1\\ 4 \u0026 2\\ \\mathcal{R}_1\\ 8 \\\\ 5\\ \\mathcal{R}_1\\ 8 \u0026 5\\ \\mathcal{R}_1\\ 10 \\end{array} \\] Example 4.4.2 Reconsider the Cartesian Product\n\\[ \\begin{array}{c c c c c c c c c} A \\times B \u0026 = \u0026 \\{ \u0026 (1, 2), \u0026 (1, 4), \u0026 (1, 6), \u0026 (1, 8), \u0026 (1, 10), \u0026 \\\\ \u0026 \u0026 \u0026 (2, 2), \u0026 (2, 4), \u0026 (2, 6), \u0026 (2, 8), \u0026 (2, 10), \u0026 \\\\ \u0026 \u0026 \u0026 (3, 2), \u0026 (3, 4), \u0026 (3, 6), \u0026 (3, 8), \u0026 (3, 10), \u0026 \\\\ \u0026 \u0026 \u0026 (4, 2), \u0026 (4, 4), \u0026 (4, 6), \u0026 (4, 8), \u0026 (4, 10), \u0026 \\\\ \u0026 \u0026 \u0026 (5, 2), \u0026 (5, 4), \u0026 (5, 6), \u0026 (5, 8), \u0026 (5, 10) \u0026 \\} \\\\ \\end{array} \\]from Example 4.4.1.\nInstead of picking arbitrary elements, let’s choose elements that satisfy some\nrule.\nOne relation we could take is\n$$(a, b) \\in\\ \\mathcal{R}_2\\ \\text{ if } b = 2a$$One such ordered pair is (2, 4) because 4 = 2(2). Another such ordered pair is (1, 2) because 2 = 2(1). There are other ordered pairs in the relation:\n$$\\mathcal{R}_2 = \\{(1, 2), (2, 4), (3, 6), (4, 8), (5, 10)\\}$$Another relation we could take is\n$$\\mathcal{R}_3 = \\{(a, b)\\ |\\ a = 3 \\lor b = 2\\}$$where the ordered pairs we are interested in either have 3 as the first element, 2 as the second element, or both. This relation is the set\n$$\\mathcal{R}_3 = \\{(3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 6), (3, 8), (3, 10), (1, 2), (2, 2), (4, 2), (5, 2)\\}$$Going off $\\mathcal{R}_3$, we can also use the logical and operation:\n\\[ \\begin{align*} \\mathcal{R}_4 \u0026= \\{(a, b)\\ |\\ a = 3 \\land b = 2\\} \\\\ \u0026= \\{(3, 2)\\} \\end{align*} \\] Example 4.4.3 Reconsider the Cartesian Product from Example 4.4.1 again:\n\\[ \\begin{array}{c c c c c c c c c} A \\times B \u0026 = \u0026 \\{ \u0026 (1, 2), \u0026 (1, 4), \u0026 (1, 6), \u0026 (1, 8), \u0026 (1, 10), \u0026 \\\\ \u0026 \u0026 \u0026 (2, 2), \u0026 (2, 4), \u0026 (2, 6), \u0026 (2, 8), \u0026 (2, 10), \u0026 \\\\ \u0026 \u0026 \u0026 (3, 2), \u0026 (3, 4), \u0026 (3, 6), \u0026 (3, 8), \u0026 (3, 10), \u0026 \\\\ \u0026 \u0026 \u0026 (4, 2), \u0026 (4, 4), \u0026 (4, 6), \u0026 (4, 8), \u0026 (4, 10), \u0026 \\\\ \u0026 \u0026 \u0026 (5, 2), \u0026 (5, 4), \u0026 (5, 6), \u0026 (5, 8), \u0026 (5, 10) \u0026 \\} \\\\ \\end{array} \\]Now consider the following relation:\n$$\\mathcal{R}_5 = \\{(a, b)\\ |\\ a = 3 \\land a = 5\\}$$Notice that none of the ordered pairs in $A \\times B$ have a first element that is simultaneously equal to 3 and 5. As such, we have that\n$$\\mathcal{R}_5 = \\emptyset$$meaning that $\\mathcal{R}_5$ is an empty relation.\nRelations on a Single Set Just like we can take the Cartesian Product of a set with itself such as $A \\times A$, we can also take subsets of $A \\times A$ to form relations from A to itself. In this case, we would call $\\mathcal{R}$ a binary relation on A. Again, we use the word binary to describe the fact that there are two sets being used to form the Cartesian Product.\nExample 4.4.4 Consider the set $A = \\{-2, -1, 0, 1, 2\\}$.\nThe Cartesian Product $A^2$ is thus\n\\[ \\begin{array}{ c c c c c c c c c } A \\times A \u0026 = \u0026 \\{ \u0026 (-2, -2), \u0026 (-2, -1), \u0026 (-2, 0), \u0026 (-2, 1), \u0026 (-2, 2), \u0026 \\\\ \u0026 \u0026 \u0026 (-1, -2), \u0026 (-1, -1), \u0026 (-1, 0), \u0026 (-1, 1), \u0026 (-1, 2), \u0026 \\\\ \u0026 \u0026 \u0026 (0, -2), \u0026 (0, -1), \u0026 (0, 0), \u0026 (0, 1), \u0026 (0, 2), \u0026 \\\\ \u0026 \u0026 \u0026 (1, -2), \u0026 (1, -1), \u0026 (1, 0), \u0026 (1, 1), \u0026 (1, 2), \u0026 \\\\ \u0026 \u0026 \u0026 (2, -2), \u0026 (2, -1), \u0026 (2, 0), \u0026 (2, 1), \u0026 (2, 2) \u0026 \\} \\end{array} \\]Consider the relation\n$$(a_1, a_2) \\in \\mathcal{R} \\text{ if } a_1 \u003c a_2$$This is the “less than” relation, so instead of writing $\\mathcal{R}$, we could use the symbol \u003c instead. As such, instead of writing $-1\\ \\mathcal{R}\\ 0$, we can now write $-1 \u003c 0$, which coincides with the commonly used mathematical notation. Here, we see that\n$$\\mathcal{R}\\ =\\ \u003c\\ =\\ \\{(-2, -1), (-2, 0), (-2, 1), (-2, 2), (-1, 0), (-1, 1), (-1, 2), (0, 1), (0, 2), (1, 2)\\}$$Note that we are using the symbol \u003c both as a comparison operator (its common usage), and as the name for a set (which is very unusual, and tends to be avoided to prevent confusion).\nExample 4.4.5 Consider the set\n$$\\bigstar = \\{0, 0.3, 0.7, 1, 1.5, 1.7, 2, 2.1, 2.11\\}$$Let $\\mathcal{R}$ be the binary relation on $\\bigstar$ defined by\n$$(a, b) \\in \\mathcal{R} \\text{ if } b = \\lceil a \\rceil$$where the second element is the ceiling of the first element. For example, because $\\lceil 0.3 \\rceil = 1$ and $\\lceil 2 \\rceil = 2$, we have that\n\\[ \\begin{align*} 0.3\\ \u0026\\mathcal{R}\\ 1 \\\\ 2\\ \u0026\\mathcal{R}\\ 2 \\end{align*} \\]We thus have that\n\\[ \\begin{align*} \\mathcal{R} \u0026= \\{\\ (x, y) \\in \\bigstar \\times \\bigstar \\ | \\ y = \\lceil x \\rceil\\} \\\\ \u0026= \\{\\ (0, \\lceil 0 \\rceil), (0.3, \\lceil 0.3 \\rceil), (0.7, \\lceil 0.7 \\rceil), (1, \\lceil 1 \\rceil), (1.5, \\lceil 1.5 \\rceil), (1.7, \\lceil 1.7 \\rceil), (2, \\lceil 2 \\rceil) \\ \\} \\\\ \u0026= \\{\\ (0, 0), (0.3, 1), (0.7, 1), (1, 1), (1.5, 2), (1.7, 2), (2, 2) \\ \\} \\end{align*} \\]Notice that since $3 \\notin \\bigstar$, we have that\n\\[ \\begin{align*} 2.1 \u0026\\cancel{\\mathcal{R}}\\ 3 \\\\ 2.11 \u0026\\cancel{\\mathcal{R}}\\ 3 \\end{align*} \\]even though the ceiling of both 2.1 and 2.11 is 3. This is because 3 is not in $\\bigstar$, meaning we have that\n\\[ \\begin{align*} (2.1, 3) \u0026\\notin \\bigstar \\times \\bigstar \\\\ (2.11, 3) \u0026\\notin \\bigstar \\times \\bigstar \\end{align*} \\]which further means that neither (2.1, 3) nor (2.11, 3) can possibly be in any subset of $\\bigstar \\times \\bigstar$.\nRelations on Three or More Sets Of course, there is nothing stopping us from considering subsets of Cartesian Products of three or more sets.\nExample 4.4.6 Consider the set of primary pigment colors and secondary pigment colors: $~$ \\[ \\begin{align*} P \u0026= \\{\\text{Red}, \\text{Yellow}, \\text{Blue}\\} \\\\ S \u0026= \\{\\text{Orange}, \\text{Green}, \\text{Purple}\\} \\end{align*} \\] Figure 4.4.1: This diagram shows how the primary pigment colors mix together to form the secondary pigment colors.\nWe can form a relation on the Cartesian Product $P \\times P \\times S$ by considering triples where the first two elements mix together to get a secondary color according to the diagram above showing how pigment colors mix together: $$\\mathcal{R} = \\{(\\text{Red}, \\text{Yellow}, \\text{Orange}), (\\text{Red}, \\text{Blue}, \\text{Purple}), (\\text{Yellow}, \\text{Blue}, \\text{Green})\\}$$ Example 4.4.7 Alternatively to pigments, light can mix together to form new colors as well, as demonstrated in Figure 4.4.2 below. Figure 4.4.2: Different wave lengths of light are different colors, which can be mixed together to form new colors. The primary colors here are Red, Green, and Blue. Pixels on screens are colored by emitting differnt comninations of those colors.\nConsider the set P of primary light colors and the set S of secondary light colors: \\[ \\begin{align*} P \u0026= \\{\\text{Red}, \\text{Green}, \\text{Blue}\\} \\\\ S \u0026= \\{\\text{Yellow}, \\text{Magenta}, \\text{Cyan}\\} \\end{align*} \\] Differently to Example 4.4.6, let's take a relation on the Cartesian Product $(P \\times P) \\times S$, which should make it easier to see what colors are mixing together to form the third color. The relation we'll take is the relation of color mixtures as defined in Figure 4.4.2 above: $$\\mathcal{R} = \\{((\\text{Red}, \\text{Green}), \\text{Yellow}), ((\\text{Red}, \\text{Blue}), \\text{Magenta}), ((\\text{Green}, \\text{Blue}), \\text{Cyan})\\}$$ Example 4.4.8 Astrid is a graphic artist for a large online magazine, and wants to upgrade her computer. Her local computer shop sells computers with four categories of specifications for the CPU, Graphics card, RAM, and Motherboard based on the following:\nThe number of CPU cores. The amount of video RAM (VRAM), measured in Gigabytes, on the Graphics card. The amount of RAM available, measured in Gigabytes, to the CPU. Whether or not the Motherboard has on-board wifi. The store offers the following options for each category:\n\\[ \\begin{align*} \\text{CPU} \u0026= \\{4, 8, 12, 16\\} \\\\ \\text{Graphics Card} \u0026= \\{8, 16, 24\\} \\\\ \\text{RAM} \u0026= \\{16, 32\\} \\\\ \\text{Wifi} \u0026= \\{\\text{Yes}, \\text{No}\\} \\end{align*} \\]Thus, all of the available configurations the store sells are captured in the Cartesian Product\n$$\\text{CPU} \\times \\text{Graphics Card} \\times \\text{RAM} \\times \\text{Wifi}$$Astrid needs a computer that can handle digital art and 3D rendering, so she wants a computer with at least 16Gb VRAM and 32Gb RAM. However, she also wants to try and save money by not splurging on a CPU, so she wants no more than 8 CPU cores. She doesn’t care if the motherboard has on-board wifi or not.\nThus, we can form a relation $\\mathcal{R}_{\\text{Astrid}}$ on $\\text{CPU} \\times \\text{Graphics Card} \\times \\text{RAM} \\times \\text{Wifi}$ by considering all options that meet Astrid’s requirement:\n\\[ \\begin{align*} \\mathcal{R}_{\\text{Astrid}} \u0026= \\{(c, v, r, w) \\in \\text{CPU} \\times \\text{Graphics Card} \\times \\text{RAM} \\times \\text{Wifi}\\ |\\ c \\le 8 \\land v \\ge 16 \\land r \\ge 32\\} \\\\ \\\\ \u0026= \\begin{array}{ c c c c c c } \\{ \u0026 (4, 16, 32, \\text{No}), \u0026 (4, 24, 32, \\text{No}), \u0026 (8, 16, 32, \\text{No}), \u0026 (8, 24, 32, \\text{No}), \u0026 \\\\ \u0026 (4, 16, 32, \\text{Yes}), \u0026 (4, 24, 32, \\text{Yes}), \u0026 (8, 16, 32, \\text{Yes}), \u0026 (8, 24, 32, \\text{Yes}) \u0026 \\} \\end{array} \\end{align*} \\]",
    "description": "When we form the Cartesian Product $A \\times B$, we are essentially pairing up every element in A with every element in B. However, we may not want to associate every element of A with every element in B. Instead, we may only want to pair up certain elements together because they satisfy some condition.\nThe way we pair up only certain elements from A to certain elements of B is to take a subset of $A \\times B$. These kinds of subsets are yet another fundamental structure that appear all throughout all of mathematics.",

    "content": "As seen in the previous section, some relations involve nested structures. For example, some relations have elements that contain ordered pairs. Remember that all elements in a relation are ordered pairs themselves, meaning the elements of some relations are ordered pairs that also contain ordered pairs. As such, when we were listing out all of the elements of a relation, we sometimes spaced them out to make it easier to see what was in each of the elements. We saw this in Example 4.4.1, and Example 4.4.8.\nThere are ways we can visually represent the contents of Cartesian Products and relations defined on those Cartesian Products. Even though diagrams may not provide rigorous logic that can’t always be used to establish results, they can help us reason about issues, and can also provide some clarity.\nHere, we’ll discuss three common ways to visualize Cartesian Products and relations. The first method we discuss will be especially helpful in the next section where we describe binary relations on a single set.\n0-1 Tables For some Cartesian Product $A \\times B$, and relation $\\mathcal{R} \\subseteq A \\times B$, remember that $(a, b) \\in \\mathcal{R}$ and $a\\ \\mathcal{R}\\ b$ are propositions (the exact same proposition). This means that they have a truth value of either true or false. This means that we can tabulate which elements in A and B are related by simply evaluating the propositions.\nTo help facilitate this process, we construct a table similar to the kind of table we used to describe Cartesian Products. Except in this new table, we’ll write the value of the proposition.\nIn other words, to write the table for relation $\\mathcal{R}$ defined on the Cartesian Product $A \\times B$, we consider the $a_i$ row and the $b_j$ column. Instead of writing the ordered pair $(a_i, b_j)$ in the $a_i^{\\text{th}}$ row and the $b_j^{\\text{th}}$ column, we write whatever $a_i\\ \\mathcal{R}\\ b_j$ evaluates to.\n$\\mathcal{R}$ $A / B$ $b_1$ $b_2$ $\\cdots$ $b_m$ $a_1$ $a_1\\ \\mathcal{R}\\ b_1$ $a_1\\ \\mathcal{R}\\ b_2$ $\\cdots$ $a_1\\ \\mathcal{R}\\ b_m$ $a_2$ $a_2\\ \\mathcal{R}\\ b_1$ $a_2\\ \\mathcal{R}\\ b_2$ $\\cdots$ $a_2\\ \\mathcal{R}\\ b_m$ $\\vdots$ $\\vdots$ $\\vdots$ $\\ddots$ $\\vdots$ $a_n$ $a_n\\ \\mathcal{R}\\ b_1$ $a_n\\ \\mathcal{R}\\ b_2$ $\\cdots$ $a_n\\ \\mathcal{R}\\ b_m$ Example 4.5.1 Consider the two sets\n\\[ \\begin{align*} A \u0026= \\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5\\} \\\\ B \u0026= \\{1, 3, 5, 7, 9\\} \\end{align*} \\]Define the relation $\\mathcal{R} \\subseteq A \\times B$ as\n$$a\\ \\mathcal{R}\\ b \\text{ if } a \\ge b$$Based on this definition, we bypass simply listing all the elements of $\\mathcal{R}$, and display them in a 0-1 table:\n$\\mathcal{R}$ $\\mathbf{A / B}$ 1 3 5 7 9 1 1 0 0 0 0 2 1 0 0 0 0 3 1 1 0 0 0 4 1 1 0 0 0 5 1 1 1 0 0 From this table, we see that the proposition $1 \\mathcal{R} 1 = 1$, meaning that the proposition $(1, 1) \\in \\mathcal{R} = 1$ as well. This was expected since we were given the relation’s definition as the “greater than or equal to” relation.\nThese kinds of tables are also useful when there is no clear “rule” determining whether or not certain elements between two sets are related. Of course the elements in a relation can be listed out, but a 0-1 table may make any patterns more evident (if any such patterns are present).\nExample 4.5.2 Consider the relation\n$$\\mathcal{R} = \\{(1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)\\}$$defined on the Cartesian Product $\\{1, 2, 3, 4\\}^2 = \\{1, 2, 3, 4\\} \\times \\{1, 2, 3, 4\\}$\nSome patient person out in the world may be able to work out what relation this is by inspecting that big list of ordered pairs, but for the rest of us, it helps to see a 0-1 table:\n$\\mathcal{R}$ $\\mathbf{\\{1, 2, 3, 4\\} / \\{1, 2, 3, 4\\}}$ 1 2 3 4 1 0 1 1 1 2 1 0 1 1 3 1 1 0 1 4 1 1 1 0 A quick look at this table reveals that the only entries that evaluate to false are the diagonal entries. All other entries evaluate to true. This suggests that a number is only related to another number if it is’nt equal. Hence, we have that\n$$a\\ \\mathcal{R}\\ b \\text{ if } a \\neq b$$This is the “not equal to” relation.\nExample 4.5.3 The math department at a certain college offers several courses: Calculus, Combinatorics, Linear Algebra, Statistics, Probability, Analysis, and Topology.\nThe department has surveyed its professors and have determined its “teaching preference” relation described by the following 0-1 table:\n$\\mathcal{R}$ $\\mathbf{P / C}$ Calculus Combinatorics Linear Algebra Statistics Probability Analysis Topology Smith 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 Gonzalez 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 Garcia 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 Ba 0 1 0 1 1 1 0 Khan 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 Of course, we see that relation $\\mathcal{R}$ is defined on the Cartesian Product $P \\times C$ where\n\\[ \\begin{align*} P \u0026= \\{\\text{Smith}, \\text{Gonzales}, \\text{Garcia}, \\text{Ba}, \\text{Khan} \\} \\\\ C \u0026= \\{\\text{Calculus}, \\text{Combinatorics}, \\text{Linear Algebra}, \\text{Statistics}, \\text{Probability}, \\text{Analysis}, \\text{Topology}\\} \\end{align*} \\]Based on the table above we see that\n\\[ \\begin{array}{ c c c c } \\text{Smith}\\ \\mathcal{R}\\ \\text{Combinatorics} \u0026 \\text{Smith}\\ \\mathcal{R}\\ \\text{Linear Algebra} \u0026 \\text{Smith}\\ \\mathcal{R}\\ \\text{Analysis} \u0026 \\text{Smith}\\ \\mathcal{R}\\ \\text{Topology} \\end{array} \\]meaning the Smith likes to teach Combinatorics, Linear Algebra, Analysis, and Toopology.\nOn the other hand, we see that\n\\[ \\begin{array}{ c c c } \\text{Garcia}\\ \\mathcal{R}\\ \\text{Calculus} \u0026 \\text{Garcia}\\ \\mathcal{R}\\ \\text{Statistics} \u0026 \\text{Garcia}\\ \\mathcal{R}\\ \\text{Probability} \\end{array} \\]meaning that Garcia has a preference for teaching Calculus, Statistics, and Probability.\nArrow Diagrams Something else we could do to visualize a relation is by directly drawing arrows between related elements. The basic idea here is that for a relation $\\mathcal{R} \\subseteq A \\times B$, we list the elements of A and the elements of B with some space in between. (The lists could be vertical or horizontal.) Next, for each element $a_i$ in A, we draw an arrow from $a_i$ to an element $b_j$ in B if $a_i$ is related to $b_j$.\nExample 4.5.4 Eustice is the manager of a technical support team for a company that maintains various pieces of equipment to service customers. Everyday, Eustice assigns technicians to monitor a piece of equipment. Sometimes, more than one technician works on a piece of equipment. $$~$$ The team consists of Alex, Brady, Chelsey, Danielle, Frank, and Gertrude. Everyday, the team must monitor a server, a router, a firewall, and a database. On a particular day, Eustice made the following assignments for the equipment, resulting in the \"assignment\" relation. It should be apparent from Example 4.5.4 that arrow diagrams can look cluttered unless a lot of care is taken to properly space out the elements in the diagram. These are not used often, but are still available when feasible.\nTree Diagrams One shortcoming with the previous methods is that they do not easily accomodate Cartesian Products with three or more sets.\nTree diagrams easily accomodate more than two sets in a Cartesian Product. However, depending on how many elements are in the sets, tree diagrams can become quite unwieldy.\nA tree diagram is usually constructed starting from the left and progressing to the right. We start with a single dot, called the root of the tree. From this root, lines emanate to each of the elements in the first set listed in the Cartesian Product. Then, from each element in that first set, a line is extended to each of the elements from the second set listed in the Cartesian Product. However, each element of the first set gets its own copy of the elements in the second. Along each branch of the tree, we write the n-tuple containing all elements up to that branch in the tree. This process is repeated for each subsequent set in the Cartesian Product.\nExample 4.5.5 In a standard deck of playing cards, each card has a suit which can be one of Spades (♠), Hearts (♥), Diamonds (♦), or Clubs (♣). Furthermore, each card is colored either Red (R) or Black (B).\nAlso consider a coin, which when flipped, either results in Heads (H) or Tails (T).\nWe capture these outcomes in the following sets.\n\\[ \\begin{align*} \\text{Suit} \u0026= \\{\\text{♠}, \\text{♥}, \\text{♦}, \\text{♣}\\} \\\\ \\text{Color} \u0026= \\{\\text{B}, \\text{R}\\} \\\\ \\text{Flip} \u0026= \\{\\text{H}, \\text{T}\\} \\end{align*} \\]We construct the tree diagram for $\\text{Suit} \\times \\text{Color} \\times \\text{Flip}$ below in a top-down style:\n( ♠ , B , ( H ♠ ) , B ( ) ♠ , B , T ) ♠ ( ♠ , R , ( H ♠ ) , R ( ) ♠ , R , T ) ( ♥ , B , ( H ♥ ) , B ( ) ♥ , B , T ) ♥ ( ♥ , R , ( H ♥ ) , R ( ) ♥ , R , T ) ( ♦ , B , ( H ♦ ) , B ( ) ♦ , B , T ) ♦ ( ♦ , R , ( H ♦ ) , R ( ) ♦ , R , T ) ( ♣ , B , ( H ♣ ) , B ( ) ♣ , B , T ) ♣ ( ♣ , R , ( H ♣ ) , R ( ) ♣ , R , T ) Notice in Example 4.5.5 that in the first level of the tree the elements are not enclosed in parentheses ( ). Since they are single elements, there is not much point in surrounding them, creating 1-tuples. At that point, we have not formed a Cartesian Product, so it’s unnecessary. Though in a sense, a single element could be considered a 1-tuple by itself. Either way, we intentionally do not enclose the first elements in ( ).\nRemember that order matters when writing the sets in a Cartesian Product. As such, we expect the tree diagram representing the Cartesian Product to look different based on how the sets are ordered.\nExample 4.5.6 Reconsider the sets from Example 4.5.5. A vertical tree diagram for $\\text{Flip} \\times \\text{Suit} \\times \\text{Color}$ that goes bottom-to-top would look similar to this diagram.\n( H , ♠ , R ( ) H , ( ♠ H ) , ♠ , B ) ( H , ♥ , R ( ) H , ( ♥ H ) , ♥ , B ) H ( H , ♦ , R ( ) H , ( ♦ H ) , ♦ , B ) ( H , ♣ , R ( ) H , ( ♣ H ) , ♣ , B ) ( T , ♠ , R ( ) T , ( ♠ T ) , ♠ , B ) ( T , ♥ , R ( ) T , ( ♥ T ) , ♥ , B ) T ( T , ♦ , R ( ) T , ( ♦ T ) , ♦ , B ) ( T , ♣ , R ( ) T , ( ♣ T ) , ♣ , B ) To represnt a relation, we simply remove any branches that yield n-tuples that are not in the relation. The act of removing such branches is sometimes called pruning in keeping with the arbor theme.\nExample 4.5.7 Reconsider the tree diagram from Example 4.5.5:\n( ♠ , B , ( H ♠ ) , B ( ) ♠ , B , T ) ♠ ( ♠ , R , ( H ♠ ) , R ( ) ♠ , R , T ) ( ♥ , B , ( H ♥ ) , B ( ) ♥ , B , T ) ♥ ( ♥ , R , ( H ♥ ) , R ( ) ♥ , R , T ) ( ♦ , B , ( H ♦ ) , B ( ) ♦ , B , T ) ♦ ( ♦ , R , ( H ♦ ) , R ( ) ♦ , R , T ) ( ♣ , B , ( H ♣ ) , B ( ) ♣ , B , T ) ♣ ( ♣ , R , ( H ♣ ) , R ( ) ♣ , R , T ) Notice that in the second level with the ordered pairs that ♠ is being paired up with the color red. We also see that ♥ is being paired up with the color black. However, in a normal deck of cards, those suits are not those colors.\nTo make an authentic deck of cards, lets consider the following relation:\n$$\\mathcal{R} = \\{(\\text{s}, \\text{c}, \\text{f})\\ |\\ \\bigl[(\\text{s} = ♠ \\lor ♣) \\rightarrow (\\text{c} = B)\\bigr] \\land \\bigl[(\\text{s} = ♥ \\lor ♦) \\rightarrow (\\text{c} = R)\\bigr] \\}$$This relation says that if the card is in the relation and has a suit of spades or clubs, that would imply the card’s color is black. Similarly, if a card in the relation has a suit of either hearts or diamonds, that would imply that the card’s color is red.\nLet’s put a slash through each branch that yields ordered pairs not in $\\mathcal{R}$.\n( ♠ , B , ( H ♠ ) , B ( ) ♠ , B , T ) ♠ ( ♠ , R , ( H ♠ ) , R ( ) ♠ , R , T ) ( ♥ , B , ( H ♥ ) , B ( ) ♥ , B , T ) ♥ ( ♥ , R , ( H ♥ ) , R ( ) ♥ , R , T ) ( ♦ , B , ( H ♦ ) , B ( ) ♦ , B , T ) ♦ ( ♦ , R , ( H ♦ ) , R ( ) ♦ , R , T ) ( ♣ , B , ( H ♣ ) , B ( ) ♣ , B , T ) ♣ ( ♣ , R , ( H ♣ ) , R ( ) ♣ , R , T ) We don’t need tp prune any sub-branches because they are considered pruned if their ancestor branches are pruned. We could go one step further and simply redraw the tree diagram without any of the pruned branches.\n( ♠ , B , ( H ♠ ) , B ( ) ♠ , B , T ) ♠ ♥ ( ♥ , R , ( H ♥ ) , R ( ) ♥ , R , T ) ♦ ( ♦ , R , ( H ♦ ) , R ( ) ♦ , R , T ) ( ♣ , B , ( H ♣ ) , B ( ) ♣ , B , T ) ♣ With less branches, we could make an equivalent tree diagram that is a little more compact:\n( ♠ , B , ( H ♠ ) ♠ , B ( ) ♠ , B , T ) ( ♥ , R , ( H ♥ ) ♥ , R ( ) ♥ , R , T ) ( ♦ , R , ( H ♦ ) ♦ , R ( ) ♦ , R , T ) ( ♣ , B , ( H ♣ ) ♣ , B ( ) ♣ , B , T ) Note that we don’t necessarily have to construct the tree for the entire Cartesian Product, and then prune branches to get the tree diagram for the desired relation. We could instead preemptively prune to prevent the tree from growing too large in the first place.\nExample 4.5.8 Reconsider the Cartesian Product $\\text{Flip} \\times \\text{Suit} \\times \\text{Color}$ from Example 4.5.6. Suppose we impose the following conditions:\nHeads can’t pair up with Hearts Tails can only pair up with Diamonds Of course, just like with Example 4.5.7, we would like to exclude any ordered triples that yield improperly colored cards. Instead of constructing the tree for the entire Cartesian Product, let’s just draw what we need:\n( H ( , H ♠ , , ♠ B ) ) ( H ( , H ♦ , H , ♦ R ) ) ( H ( , H ♣ , , ♣ B ) ) ( T ( , T ♦ , T , ♦ R ) )",
