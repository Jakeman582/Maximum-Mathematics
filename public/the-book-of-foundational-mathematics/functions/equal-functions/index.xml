    <title>Equal Functions :: Maximum Mathematics</title>
    <link>http://localhost:1313/the-book-of-foundational-mathematics/functions/equal-functions/index.html</link>
    <description>We’ve previously discussed when two sets are considered equal, and when two ordered pairs are equal. We then extended the idea of set equality to see when two Cartesian products were considered equal (because Cartesian products are simply sets of ordered pairs).&#xA;However, we have not yet discussed when two relations are equal. As we saw in Section 5.6 Characterizing Relations, the sets on which a relation is defined can drastically alter that relation’s properties. A relation $\mathcal{R}$ may be reflexive on $A^2$, but may not be reflexive on $B^2$ even though $\mathcal{R}$ is the same set in each case.</description>
