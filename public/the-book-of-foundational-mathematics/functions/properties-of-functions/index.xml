    <title>Properties of Functions :: Maximum Mathematics</title>
    <link>http://localhost:1313/the-book-of-foundational-mathematics/functions/properties-of-functions/index.html</link>
    <description>In the last section, we talked about certain kinds of functions that have properties not had by other functions. Surjective functions have properties not shared with injective functions, and vice-versa. In this section, we swing back to talking about properties that all functions have, though the last property we talk about is a bit more refined when the underlying function is injective.&#xA;Empty Inputs Produce Empty Outputs One classic analogy mathematicians use to talk about functions is that of a machine. Simply put, a machine is a device that takes in some input, operates on that input, and produces an output. Like machines, a function takes in an input, and based on how the function is defined, produces an output.</description>
