    <description>We have defined functions basically as special types of relations. We can go further and recognize that some functions have special properties different than other functions. In this section, we examine three properties that tend to be useful when working on various problems all throughout mathematics.&#xA;Surjective Functions Example 6.2.1 Consider the sets $A = \{1, 2, 3, 4, 5\}$ and $B = \{\alpha, \beta, \gamma, \delta\}$. In Figure 6.2.1 below, we use an arrow diagram to define two functions $f_1$ and $f_2$ from $A$ to $B$. Figure 6.2.1</description>
