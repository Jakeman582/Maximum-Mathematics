      <description>Often when dealing with problems in mathematics, we make use of certain facts. For example, when dealing with geometry problems on a flat surface, we often make use of the Pythagorean Theorem and the Angle Bisector Theorem. When dealing with quadratic equations, we can use the Quadratic Formula to calculate its roots. The Fundamental Theorem of Calculus gives us a way to relate integrals and derivatives.&#xA;But how do we know that the Pythagorean Theorem, Angle Bisector Theorem, or the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus are true? How do we know that the Quadratic Formula gives us the correct roots, and not some mere approximation, or worse outright lies about the roots? Can we trust that these theorems, or the myriad of other theorems, accurately describe reality?</description>

      <description>Relations are used all throughout mathematics. Examples of relations abound in subjects such as algebra, trigonometry, calculus, as well as computer science, physics, chemistry, biology, and economics.</description>

      <description>In the previous chapter, we studied a way to relate elements of one set to another set. However, we didnâ€™t place any restrictions on those relations. Usually, we want to have some specific type of structure in the way we relate elements.&#xA;Throughout our normal schooling, we encounter many types of these structured relations. Specifically, the kinds of relations we studied were functions. In this chapter, we delve deeper into these special kind of relations, and study them in an abstract sense. That is to say, what we discuss here will be applicable to all functions, not just those more familiar functions that relate real numbers to other real numbers.</description>
