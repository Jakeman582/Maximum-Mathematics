    <title>Logic :: Maximum Mathematics</title>
    <link>http://localhost:1313/the-book-of-foundational-mathematics/logic/index.html</link>
    <description>Often when dealing with problems in mathematics, we make use of certain facts. For example, when dealing with geometry problems on a flat surface, we often make use of the Pythagorean Theorem and the Angle Bisector Theorem. When dealing with quadratic equations, we can use the Quadratic Formula to calculate its roots. The Fundamental Theorem of Calculus gives us a way to relate integrals and derivatives.&#xA;But how do we know that the Pythagorean Theorem, Angle Bisector Theorem, or the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus are true? How do we know that the Quadratic Formula gives us the correct roots, and not some mere approximation, or worse outright lies about the roots? Can we trust that these theorems, or the myriad of other theorems, accurately describe reality?</description>

      <description>Logic provides a formal framework for expressing truth using precise symbolic systems. The most fundamental components of this framework are the statements we reason about - declarations that can be judged as being either true or false. On their own, these statements capture simple facts. Combining them in structured ways, we can express more complex ideas and uncover logical relationships.&#xA;This section explores the basic building blocks of logical expression and how they interact. By understanding these foundations, we lay the groundwork for more advanced reasoning - an essential tool in set theory, calculus, modern algebra, and combinatorics in addition to logic itself. In these areas, precise argumentation and structure play a role.</description>

      <title>Modeling Logic With Truth Tables</title>

      <description>In Section 1.1, having to write out all logical expressions in English and keeping track of truth values can be tedious and time-consuming. It also makes it difficult to evaluate the truth value of compound statements involving many propositions and logical connectives.&#xA;In analyzing a compound statement’s truth value, we need to be able to evaluate it for all combinations of truth values for its constituent parts. Without any organization, this can be quite error-prone. For example, to analyze the compound statement $p \land q$, we have to check four cases: $p$ and $q$ are both false, $p$ is false and $q$ is true, $p$ is true and $q$ is false, and both $p$ and $q$ are true. Without any systematic way of dealing with each case, mistakes are easy to make.</description>

      <title>Always True, Always False</title>

      <description>Now that we have a fairly organized way of analyzing the truth value of compound propositions, we’ll start to see some interesting phenomena crop up from time-to-time. We’ll do this by looking at all possible values a proposition can take, which is precisely what truth tables allow us to do.&#xA;Tautologies Example 1.3.1 Let&#39;s examine the proposition $p \rightarrow (p \lor q)$. We&#39;ll start with a blank truth table. We start by filling out the column for $p \lor q$: Now that we have the truth values for propositions $p$ and $p \lor q$, it is easy to calculate the truth values for $p \rightarrow (p \lor q)$: Now we remove the extraneous column for $p \lor q$ to get the final truth table: All of the values in the final column are $1$! This means that, no matter what truth values $p$ and $q$ have, the expression $p \rightarrow (p \lor q)$ is always $\text{true}$. $$~$$ Translating the proposition $p \rightarrow (p \lor q)$ into English yields something like this: $$\text{If p, then p or q.}$$ Of course if we start with proposition $p$, then we must also have $p \lor q$ as well because $p$ is included in the conclusion. For example, suppose we had that \[ \begin{align*} p &amp;: \text{Phil opens up a new savings account.} \\ q &amp;: \text{Phil earns 4% interest every year, compounded monthly.} \end{align*} \] Then the proposition $p \rightarrow (p \lor q)$ can be translated as follows: \[ \begin{align*} &amp;\text{If Phil opens up a new savings account, then} \\ &amp;\text{either Phil opens up a new savings account, or } \\ &amp;\text{he will earn 4% interest every year compounded monthly, } \\ &amp;\text{or both.} \end{align*} \] $$~$$ Of course if Phil opens a new savings account, then he will either open up a new savings account (which he just supposedly did), or he will earn 4% interest compounded monthly, or both. There is a special name for propositions that are always true, no matter what truth values are held by its constituent parts.</description>
