    <title>Modeling Logic With Truth Tables :: Maximum Mathematics</title>
    <link>http://localhost:1313/the-book-of-foundational-mathematics/logic/modeling-logic-with-truth-tables/index.html</link>
    <description>In Section 1.1, having to write out all logical expressions in English and keeping track of truth values can be tedious and time-consuming. It also makes it difficult to evaluate the truth value of compound statements involving many propositions and logical connectives.&#xA;In analyzing a compound statementâ€™s truth value, we need to be able to evaluate it for all combinations of truth values for its constituent parts. Without any organization, this can be quite error-prone. For example, to analyze the compound statement $p \land q$, we have to check four cases: $p$ and $q$ are both false, $p$ is false and $q$ is true, $p$ is true and $q$ is false, and both $p$ and $q$ are true. Without any systematic way of dealing with each case, mistakes are easy to make.</description>
