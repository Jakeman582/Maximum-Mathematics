    <title>Order of Operations :: Maximum Mathematics</title>
    <link>http://localhost:1313/the-book-of-foundational-mathematics/logic/order-of-operations/index.html</link>
    <description>When weâ€™re trying to calculate arithmetic expressions like&#xA;$$8 \div 2((2 + 2) * 3)$$we need to know which parts of the expression need to be dealt with first.&#xA;One scheme is PEMDAS which stands for Parenthesis Exponents Multiplication Division Addition Subtraction. The order the operations are listed specifies which parts are to be done first. The order is a little misleading though since multiplication and division are performed left-to-right instead of in sequence. Addition and subtraction are also done left-to-right instead of in sequence. If a number is written next to parenthesis without an explicit operator, then the implicit operator being used is multiplication.</description>
