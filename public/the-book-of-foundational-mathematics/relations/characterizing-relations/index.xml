    <title>Characterizing Relations :: Maximum Mathematics</title>
    <link>http://localhost:1313/the-book-of-foundational-mathematics/relations/characterizing-relations/index.html</link>
    <description>In the previous couple of sections, we defined relations and described some ways to make it easier to visualize what elements were in those relations. Here, we take a closer look at relations defined on a single set. More specifically, weâ€™ll look at some properties of a relation $\mathcal{R}$ defined on a single set A (that is, $\mathcal{R} \subseteq A^2$).&#xA;Reflexive Relations Perhaps the easiest property to verify for each relation is whether or not every element of A is related to itself under the given relation.</description>
