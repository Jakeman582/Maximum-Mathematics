    <title>Composite Relations :: Maximum Mathematics</title>
    <link>http://localhost:1313/the-book-of-foundational-mathematics/relations/composite-relations/index.html</link>
    <description>Consider the two relations $\mathcal{R}_1 \subseteq X \times Y$ and $\mathcal{R}_2 \subseteq Y \times Z$. Suppose we knew that $x\ \mathcal{R}_1\ y$ and that $y\ \mathcal{R}_2\ z$. Just like with transitivity, we may ask whether or not $x$ could be related to $z$, with $y$ acting as an intermediary.&#xA;What we could do is form a new relation $\mathcal{R}_3 \subseteq X \times Z$ where $(x, z) \in \mathcal{R}_3$ that captures this relationship between $x$ and $z$. This is exactly what a composite relation does.</description>
