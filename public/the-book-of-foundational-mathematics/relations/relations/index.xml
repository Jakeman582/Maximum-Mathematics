    <description>When we form the Cartesian Product $A \times B$, we are essentially pairing up every element in A with every element in B. However, we may not want to associate every element of A with every element in B. Instead, we may only want to pair up certain elements together because they satisfy some condition.&#xA;The way we pair up only certain elements from A to certain elements of B is to take a subset of $A \times B$. These kinds of subsets are yet another fundamental structure that appear all throughout all of mathematics.</description>
